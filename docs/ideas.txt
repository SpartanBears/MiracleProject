		Each class will have its own level that will determine which skills, from the skill roster for that class, will
		the adventurer be able to use.


	Adventurers and Skills

		Adventurers will have access to Race unique skills and Class unique skills.
		Races and Class will have a pool of skills, and Adventurers, upon creating and
		promotion, will "roll a dice" to get a few of those skills, making each Adventurer unique.

	Level, Stats & Attributes

		Character levels will go from 1 to 99, with the chance of being "reborn" at level 99, going back to
		level 1 with extra base stat points.

		For each level up the character will get Math.ceil((Level*0.25)+2) stat points.
		Stats will be allocated pseudo randomly depending on the character class and race.
		The player will be able to reallocate all the points after paying A HUGE LOT OF MONEY.
		Stats will go from 1 to 99.

		Attributes will be calculated depending on the character stats using the following formulas (OUTATED, CHECK XLS):

			- HP (integer)
				Math.ceil(VIT*2.5) + (Level*(Math.ceil(Level/10)+10)) + bonuses

			- DEF (integer)
				(VIT*3) + (DEX*2) + ((Level*(VIT+DEX))/5) + bonuses

			- MDEF (integer)
				(VIT*2) + (INT*3) + ((Level*(VIT+INT)/)5) + bonuses

			- EVA (integer)
				(AGI*3) + (DEX*1.5) + bonuses

			- ATK (integer)
				(STR*3) + (AGI*1.25) + ((Level*(STR+AGI))/5)

			- MATK (integer)
				(INT*4) + ((Level*(INT*2))/5)

			- ASPD (integer - Ticks per attack - MIN 20 TICKS) 
				Math.floor(AGI/3) + Math.floor(DEX/5) + bonuses

			- CSPD (integer - cooldown ticks reduction)
				Math.floor(DEX/2) + Math.floor(AGI/3) + bonuses

			- HIT (integer)
				(DEX*3) + (INT*0.5) + bonuses
			
			- CRIT
				(STR/7) + (INT/7) + (DEX/5) + (AGI/5) + (LUK/3) + bonuses


	Combat System

		- Damage
			ATK vs DEF and MATK vs MDEF
				ATK is the ammount of HP deducted from the enemy if the attack succedes
				DEF is the ammount of damage mitigated
				i.e: 100 ATK vs 36 DEF = Defender gets damaged for 64 points
				This is an oversimplified explanation. Check "Damage Calculation".

				Damage calculation

					DD = Damage dealt
					AWBD = Attacker Weapon Base Damage
					ASAF = Attacker Stat Affinity Damage
					AAM = Attacker Armor Modifier (Checks against Defender)
					EM = Attacker Element Modifier (Checks against Defender)

					DD = (AWBD + ASAF) * AAM * EM

					Attacks
					Piercing - Earth lvl 1 - ATK 27
					Adventurer Lvl 47, 42 STR, 58 AGI , 31 DEX
					Total attack before modifiers = 27 + (42*3)

					Defends
					Medium - Wind lvl 1 - DEF 18
					Adventurer Lvl 52, 72 VIT, 52 DEX



		- Evasion
			HIT vs EVA
			HIT and EVA are bot integers that interact as inverses.
			i.e: 100 HIT vs 100 EVA = 0 (50% chance of landing an attack)
			Using the example above, we will define that 0 represents 50% of landing an attack.
			Every 10/100 (not sure yet) points 5% will be added to that probability.
			i.e: 110 HIT vs 100 EVA = 10 (55% of landing an attack).
			The same logic applies for EVA > HIT

			LUCKY DODGE
			Formula (?)
			

		- ASPD
			Every encounter will have a timer in ticks (ms, secs, whatever)
			Every Character will perform an action every X ticks depending on their ASPD.
			0 ASPD = 100 ticks = 1 sec
			Every ASPD reduces the base ticks by 2.

			I.E: 72 AGI 34 DEX = 30 = 100 - 30 = 70 ticks per attack
			
			Attacks are instantaneous. Skills may, or may not, have a delay (SEE CSPD).

		- CSPD
			Skills will have a cast tick counter (as the basic attack does) and a channel tick counter.
			The cast tick counter is the same as the attack, but, the channel tick counter starts counting after the Skill/Spell has been used.
			In order to reduce that counter, CSPD exists.
			Every spell will have its own channel tick counter.

			i.e: Fireball has a channel tick counter of 89. Adventurer has 72 DEX 47 AGI = 51 CSPD = 89 - 51 = 38 ticks to cast

		- Once the combat starts, stats cannot be modified in any way, except for some skills that will forcefully unequip an item from an adventurer, and if that
		  item gave the adventurer bonus stats, he will lose that bonus and the attributes will be recalculated accordingly.

	
	Items

		Items will have a base ATK/MATK which will be directly added to the adventurer wielding it.
		Also, items may grant the wielder bonus stats.

		Armor types
		- Light
		- Medium
		- Heavy

		Each armor type will have a primary and secondary affinity for an adventurer stat

		Light = AGI/INT + DEX
		Medium = DEX/STR + VIT
		Heavy = VIT/STR + DEX

		The base defense of the armor will be modified by the armor type affinity
			PA = Primary affinity
			SA = Secondary affinity
			BDEF = Base DEF or MDEF

			Math.ceil(BDEF + (BDEF*((PA*0.15)/100)) + (BDEF*((SA*0.075)/100)))

			Type MEDIUM
			BDEF = 50
			DEX  = 75 <- (DEX > STR)
			STR = 50
			VIT = 27

			Math.ceil(50 + (50*((75*0.15)/100)) + (50*((27*0.075)/100))) = 57

		Items will have a damage type and element type

		Damage types
		- Slash
		- Blunt
		- Piercing
		- Magic

		Each damage type will have a primary and secondary affinity for an adventurer stat

		Slash =  DEX + STR
		Blunt = STR + VIT
		Piercing = AGI + DEX
		Magic = INT + DEX

		The base damage of the weapon will be modified by the damage type affinity
			PA = Primary affinity
			SA = Secondary affinity
			BDMG = Base ATK or MATK

			BDMG + (BDMG*((PA*0.15)/100)) + (BDMG*((SA*0.075)/100))

			Type SLASH
			BDMG = 100
			DEX  = 75
			STR = 50

			100 + (100*((75*0.15)/100)) + (100*((50*0.075)/100)) = 115

	Element system

		All damage and defense will have an element.
		Depending on the element the calculations may vary.
		Elements will have strengths and weaknesses against other elements.

		Element types
		 - Neutral
		 - Water
		 - Earth
		 - Fire
		 - Wind
		 - Poison
		 - Holy
		 - Shadow
		 - Ghost
		 - Undead
		 - Divine

	Buffs

		Buffs will be an special type of skill that increases an adventurers ATTRIBUTES (hp, def, mdef, eva, atk, matk, aspd, cspd, hit, crit)
