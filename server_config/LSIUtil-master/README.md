# LSIUtil
Archive of the LSIUtil RAID controller software binaries and source.

A tool for working with some LSI RAID controllers, I have used it for controlling a SAS1068E on linux (LSI Logic / Symbios Logic SAS1068E PCI-Express Fusion-MPT SAS (rev 08))

LSIUtil is kind of hard to find online in binary format or source.
If you find binaries or source for different versions, feel free to make a pull request.
Hope this helps someone.
