	Level, Stats & Attributes

	Character levels will go from 1 to 99, with the chance of being "reborn" at level 99, going back to
	level 1 with extra stat points.

	For each level up the character will get Math.ceil((Level*0.25)+5) stat points.
	Stats will be allocated pseudo randomly depending on the character class and race.
	The player will be able to reallocate all the points after paying A HUGE LOT OF MONEY.
	Stats will go from 1 to 99.

	Attributes will be calculated depending on the character stats using the following formulas:

		- HP (integer)
			(VIT*2.5) + (Level*(Math.floor(Level/10)+10)) + bonuses

		- DEF (FLOAT %)
			(VIT*0.3) + (DEX*0.09) + (Level*0.125) + bonuses

		- MDEF (integer)
			(VIT*0.15) + (INT*0.3) + (Level*0.125) + bonuses

		- EVA (integer)
			(AGI*3) + (DEX*1.5) + bonuses

		- ATK (integer)
			(STR*3) + (AGI*1.25) + ((Level*(STR+AGI))/5)

		- MATK (integer)
			(INT*4) + ((Level*(INT*2))/5)

		- ASPD (FLOAT - Attacks per tick) 
			(AGI*0.0125) + (DEX*0.005) + bonuses

		- CSPD (FLOAT - Delay reduction factor)
			(DEX*0.005) + (AGI*0.0025) + bonuses

		- HIT (integer)
			(DEX*3) + (INT*0.5) + bonuses


	Combat System

	- Damage
		ATK vs DEF and MATK vs MDEF
			ATK is the ammount of HP deducted from the enemy if the attack succedes
			DEF is the percentage of ATK mitigated
			i.e: 100 ATK vs 36.5 DEF = Defender gets damaged for 64 points

	- Evasion
		HIT vs EVA
		HIT and EVA are bot integers that interact as inverses.
		i.e: 100 HIT vs 100 EVA = 0 (50% chance of landing an attack)
		Using the example above, we will define that 0 represents 50% of landing an attack.
		Every 10/100 (not sure yet) points 5% will be added to that probability.
		i.e: 110 HIT vs 100 EVA = 10 (55% of landing an attack).
		The same logic applies for EVA > HIT

	- ASPD
		Every encounter will have a timer in milliseconds.
		Every Character will perform an action every X milliseconds depending on their ASPD.
		An ASPD of 1.2 allows the character to do an action every 800 milliseconds.
		An ASPD of 0.5 forces the character to just do an action every 1500 milliseconds.
		Attacks are instantaneous. Skills may, or may not, have a delay (SEE CSPD).

	- CSPD
		Skills/Spells may have a delay, CSPD reduces that delay by a percentage.
		If the Skill/Spell has a 2 second delay, and the character has 0.5 CSPD,
		the delay of using/casting that Skill/Spell will be 1 second.
