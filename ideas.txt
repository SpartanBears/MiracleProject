	Level, Stats & Attributes

	Character levels will go from 1 to 99, with the chance of being "reborn" at level 99, going back to
	level 1 with extra stat points.

	For each level up the character will get 5+log? stat points.
	Stats will be allocated pseudo randomly depending on the character class and race.
	The player will be able to reallocate all the points after paying A HUGE LOT OF MONEY.
	Stats will go from 1 to 99.

	Attributes will be calculated depending on the character stats using the following formulas:

		- HP (INT)
			(VIT*2.5) + (Level*(Math.floor(Level/10)+10)) + bonuses

		- DEF (INT)
			(VIT*3) + (DEX*1.5) + (Level*((VIT+DEX)*0.5)) + bonuses

		- MDEF (INT)
			(VIT*1.5) + (INT*3) + (Level*((VIT+INT)*0.5)) + bonuses

		- EVA (PROB) 9.99 MAX
			(AGI*0.05) + (DEX*0.025) + bonuses

		- ATK
			(STR*3) + (AGI*1.25) + ((Level*(STR+AGI))/5)

		- MATK
			(INT*4) + ((Level*(INT*2))/5)

		- ASPD (Attacks per frame - APF) 
			(AGI*0.0125) + (DEX*0.005) + bonuses

		- CSPD (Delay reduction factor)
			(DEX*0.005) + (AGI*0.0025) + bonuses

		- HIT ()
